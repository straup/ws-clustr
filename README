ws-clustr

ws-clustr is a bare-bones web interface, written in PHP, to the command-line
Clustr application.
How does it work?

To generate a shapefile using ws-clustr simply send a binary (HTTP) POST
containing the points you want to clustrize. ws-clustr will send back a
compressed shapefile! For example:

$> curl --data-binary '@/path/to/points.txt' http://example.com/ws-clustr/ >
~/path/to/clustr.tar.gz

Details

The file you pass should be formatted as <tag> <lon> <lat> , where tag is any
unique string.

You may also pass the following HTTP headers with your request:

    * x-clustr-alpha.Specify the size of the alpha number to run Clustr
      with. The default value is 0.01
    * x-clustr-name. Specify the name of the output file to create. Valid names
      may only contain the characters a-z (case-insensitive), 0-9 and
      dashes. The default value is clustr-the current process ID

That's it.

There are no ponies. No.
