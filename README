ws-clustr

ws-clustr is a bare-bones web interface, written in PHP, to the command-line
Clustr application.
How does it work?

To generate a shapefile using ws-clustr simply send a binary (HTTP) POST
containing the points you want to clustrize. ws-clustr will send back a
compressed shapefile! For example:

$> curl --data-binary '@/path/to/points.txt' http://example.com/ws-clustr/ >
~/path/to/clustr.tar.gz

Details

The file you pass should be formatted as <tag> <lon> <lat> , where tag is any
unique string.

You may also pass the following HTTP headers with your request:

    * x-clustr-alpha.Specify the size of the alpha number to run Clustr
      with. The default value is 0.01
    * x-clustr-name. Specify the name of the output file to create. Valid names
      may only contain the characters a-z (case-insensitive), 0-9 and
      dashes. The default value is clustr-the current process ID

That's it.

There are no ponies. No.

# If you don't have a local copy of Clustr and want to run this on
# mapfromscratch.com AMI which is bundled with Clustr, do this:

# First set up the Maps From Scratch AMI and log in

your-computer> ec2-run-instances ami-4d769124 -k RSA_KEY_NAME

your-computer> ec2-describe-instances
RESERVATION     r-xxxxxxxx      0xxxxxxxx    default
INSTANCE        i-xxxxxxxx      ami-4d769124 ec2-xxxx.amazonaws.com        ip-xxxx.ec2.internal

your-computer> ssh -i RSA_KEY root@ec2-xxxx.amazonaws.com

# Install Git, PHP5 and suck down a copy of ws-clustr

ec2-machine> apt-get install php5
ec2-machine> /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
ec2-machine> apt-get install git-core
ec2-machine> git clone git://github.com/straup/ws-clustr.git  

# Move it in Apache root directory:

ec2-machine> ln -s /root/ws-clustr /var/www

# Uh... that's it. Go to: 

http://ec2-xxxx.amazonaws.com/ws-clustr/

# If you want to create your ws-clustr AMI, this worked for me:

# First log out and copy your AWS key and certificate

ec2-machine> exit
your-computer> scp -i RSA_KEY EC2_KEY EC2_CERT http://ec2-xxxx.amazonaws.com/mnt/

# Now log back in and create the bundle explicitly excluding the directory with
# your AWS key and certificate

your-computer> ssh -i RSA_KEY root@ec2-xxxx.amazonaws.com
ec2-machine> ec2-bundle-vol -d /mnt -k EC2_KEY -c EC2_CERT -u AWS_USERID

(wait)

ec2-machine> ec2-upload-bundle -m /mnt/image.manifest.xml -b BUCKETNAME -a AWS_KEY -s AWS_SECRET

# For some reason this doesn't seem to be included on ec2 machines proper...

ec2-machine> exit
your-computer> ec2-register BUCKETNAME/image.manifest.xml

your-computer> ec2-register BUCKETNAME/image.manifest.xml
IMAGE   ami-9999999

# Profit!

your-computer> ec2-run-instances ami-9999999 -k EC2_KEY_SHORTNAME
